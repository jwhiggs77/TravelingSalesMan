# TravelingSalesMan
Branch and bound algorithm to find the shortest travel path for traveling salesperson
Run from Proj5GUI. 
This includes four ways to solve the Traveling Sales Person problem.
The default randomly connects a path stored in an array without finding a optimal path. 
The Greedy is a greedy algorithm implementation of the Traveling Sales Person problem for a quick but less acurate path.
The Branch and Bound implamentation is also included, finding the optimal path.
The "fancy" is an algorithm designed to be faster than the branch and bound but more accurate than the greedy. 
It builds off of the greedy algorithm but then analyzes if there is a better path avalible from point to point. 
It then improves the greedy algorithm to provide a more optimal path.
